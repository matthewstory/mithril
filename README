Mithril - One Library to Rule Them All

################################################################

Mithril - is a shiny silver metal which is both stronger and lighter than steel.

	"Mithril! All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, 
	and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, 
	light and yet harder than tempered steel. 
	Its beauty was like to that of common silver, 
	but the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim."

Mithril is a lightweight javascript utility library, designed to provide simple
functionality for cross-browser scripting.  Mithril includes interfaces to
simplify the following commonly performed tasks:

 - AJAX
 - JSON
 - DOM Traversal
 - Event Handling
 - Scoping
 - Browser Detection
 - Inheritance

Mithril is designed to be a modular library, such that each of the above stated
tasks can be performed independent of one another.
